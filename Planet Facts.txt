Mercury:
Mercury has been known to humanity since ancient times.
A year in Mercury is 88 days, yet a Mercury day is 176 Earth days.
Mercury orbits so quickly around the Sun that early civilizations believed it was actually two different stars.
The planet has just 38% of the gravity on Earth.
Mercury does not experience any seasons.
Mercury has more craters and impact marks that any other planet.

Earth:
The Earth was once believed to be the centre of the universe.
Earth is the only planet not named for a mythological god or goddess.
Earth is the most dense planet in the solar system.
The rotation of the Earth is gradually slowing down.
Earth’s atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen.
Earth has one of the most circular orbits of all the eight planets.

Mars:
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun.
Only 16 of the 39 Mars missions have been successful.
Pieces of Mars have been found on Earth. 
The tallest mountain known in the solar system is on Mars. Olympus Mons is a 21 km high!
It takes Mars 687 Earth days to orbit the Sun.
Mars does not have a magnetic field.

Venus:
Venus is the second brightest natural object in the sky.
One day on Venus is longer than one year on Earth.
Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system with an average surface temperature of 462°C (863°F).
The estimated age of the Venusian surface is around 300-400 million years old.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth. 
The atmospheric pressure of Venus is 92 times stronger than Earth’s.

Jupiter:
The first recorded sighting of Jupiter were by the ancient Babylonians in around 7th or 8th BC.
Jupiter has the shortest day of the eight planets. 
One orbit of the Sun takes Jupiter 11.86 Earth years. 
Jupiter has at least 67 moons in satellite around the planet.
The largest of Jupiter’s moons, Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.
Eight spacecraft have visited Jupiter so far.

Neptune:
It takes Neptune 164.8 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
Neptune has the second largest gravity of any planet.
Neptune has 14 known moons.
Neptune has an average surface temperature of -214°C.
Only one spacecraft, the Voyager 2, has flown past Neptune.
Neptune was discovered by Jean Joseph Le Verrier. 

Saturn:
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun.
Saturn is one of five planets able to be seen with the naked eye. 
It takes Saturn 29.4 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
Saturn gives off more energy than it receives from the Sun.
Saturn has 150 moons and smaller moonlets.
Saturn has the fastest winds of any other planet in our solar system.

Uranus:
William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781.
Uranus rotates on its axis once every 17 hours and 14 minutes. 
It takes Uranus 84 Earth days to orbit the Sun.
Uranus wind speeds can reach up to 900 km per hour.
The mass of Uranus is about 14.5 times the mass of Earth.
Uranus has 13 presently known rings.

Pluto:
Pluto was discovered on February 18th, 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh of the Lowell Observatory.
In 2006, Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet.
It takes Pluto 246.04 Earth years to orbit the Sun.
Pluto has five known moons, Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra.
The first spacecraft visited Pluto in July 2015.
Pluto’s core is predicted to be around 70% of its total diameter.

Moon:
The surface area of the moon is 14,658,000 square miles or 9.4 billion acres.
Only 59% of the moon's surface is visible from earth.
The moon rotates at 10 miles per hour compared to the earth's rotation of 1000 miles per hour.
The Moon has only been walked on by 12 people; all American males.
The first spacecraft to reach the Moon was Luna 1 in 1959:
During the 1950’s the USA considered detonating a nuclear bomb on the Moon!
